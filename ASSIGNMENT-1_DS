#  Importing the CSV and Random Libraries to read the tsv file and shuffle the list respectively

import csv
import random


#  Reading the File and moving the pointer from header to first student.


file = open("sp-22-students.tsv")
studata = csv.reader(file, delimiter='\t')
temp=next(studata)


#  Reading the data into a list named as students_list and shuffling it by using random library.


students_list=[]
for x in studata:
    students_list.append(x)
random.shuffle(students_list)


#  Taking the input for number of groups to be formed from user in integers.
# Then a for loop is runned n  times, where n = desired number of groups.
# A nested for loop will get the values(p) starting with the group number to the total number of students in the class with an equal intravels of n. 
#The pth value from students list is appended to new list created for each team.
# ### Output:
# The output will be the list of students from each new Team formed.
